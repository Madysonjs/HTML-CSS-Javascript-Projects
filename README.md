# HTML-CSS-Javascript-Projects

## Calculator
I made a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This calculator allows the user to find equations of addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication problems.

## Cinema Website
I used HTML, CSS, and Javasript to create a mock layout for a movie theater website. I used jQuery to produce the pop up form for membership sign ups and I utilized code from Bootstrap 4 to enhance the UI.

## Pizza Menu
I create this Pizza Menu using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This menu allows the user to select a size and any toppings for their pizza and then calculates the cost.

## TicTacToe
I created this game of Tictactoe using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is a two player game where the users can choose whether they would like to play as an X or an O and challenge their opponent. The game program will roll dice to decide which player will go first. The game celebrates with the winner by producing a short fun light show and declaring who won.
